# Re-evaluation of the nodulation capacity of *Sphingomonas sediminicola* DSM 18106<sup>T</sup> indicates that this strain is not capable of inducing root nodule formation on *Pisum sativum* (pea)

This repository contains the scripts and input files required to repeat the analyses reported in the associated article.

## 01_Genome_reanalysis

This folder contains the overall workflow (workflow.sh) required to repeat the assembly, annotation, and analyses of the *Sphingomonas sediminicola* DSM 18106<sup>T</sup> genome using previously published Illumina sequencing data.

## 02_DSM_18106_sequencing

This folder contains the overall workflow (workflow.sh), other scripts, and the input file required to repeat the assembly, annotation, and analyses of the *Sphingomonas sediminicola* DSM 18106<sup>T</sup> genome using Oxford Nanopore Technology sequencing data generated in this study.

## 03_DSM_18106_annotated_genome

This folder contains the *Sphingomonas sediminicola* DSM 18106<sup>T</sup> genome assembly and annotation files, as not all files had been released by NCBI by the time this manuscript was uploaded to bioRxiv.
